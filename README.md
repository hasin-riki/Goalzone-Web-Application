# Football Grounds Booking Web Application

### Description 
Booking a ground in Pakistan is a hectic task as it is solely done on phone calls or messages. Often, one does not receieve a proper confirmation or reply from ground-in-charge and in most unfortunate circumstances more than one team may be booked for the same slot. 

This web application is an idea to automate football grounds' booking in order to make it easier for players to book grounds and also avoid unnecessary conflicts. Moreover, it is also supposed to be a football community where players can register themselves and register their teams as well. In future, the app is intented to also allow posting of matches and bookings from one team in order to allow finding opponent teams for matches.
