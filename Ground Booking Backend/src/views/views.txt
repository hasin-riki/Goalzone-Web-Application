The views folder contains the template files that are used to render dynamic content on the server-side. 
In a typical Node.js application, each view defines the HTML structure and layout of a specific page or component. 
The views are typically written in a template language, such as Handlebars or EJS, and are used to render dynamic data from the server into the HTML pages that are served to the client.
